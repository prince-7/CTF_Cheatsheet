This Task is Basic RSA Task

c=ciphertext
n=p*q
p and q are primes 
phi(totient)=(p-1)*(q-1)
phi is n-1 if n is prime, you can check whether n is prime or composite from factordb
e=65537 >>2^16+1 standard exponential value
now 
d = inverse(e , phi)  >> (e*d)%phi=1
decrypted message can be obtained by >> m = pow(c,d,n)
m is a number which can be converted to ascii Flag
